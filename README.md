## PROBLEM : 
Developing Human settlements in an unplanned town(mostly B/C class towns) eventually leads to havocs/water accumulations during unexpected rainfall/floods. This leads to loss of human life, property damage, services are hindered and most importantly crops are damaged, thereby shutting down the food supply for the whole nation. 

## IDEA ABSTRACT:
We aim to come up with a digital terrain map for class B and class C towns, which analyse the prevailing human settlements in order to prevent <a href = "https://ndma.gov.in/en/media-public-awareness/disaster/natural-disaster/urban-floods.html"> **Urban Flooding** </a>.
This is to supply the land development authorities with a concrete plan as to how human settlement should be planned, identify buffer zones and passages in a city, by simulating a flood.
## Plan of Action: 
In broad terms we wish to collaborate with the water regulatory board to provide guidelines/data to make canals in order to flush out excess water, essentially a hydrograph or a heatmap of water accumulation.
